`<solvent>_t<intermdediate>.cif`: Relaxed structure of `<intermediate>` in explicit `<solvent>` environment on Au (100) surface obtained using QE in cif format

Note: t described state of intermediate, i.e., t = p (physisorbed), c (chemisorbed), a (adsorbed), and d (desorbed)

Note: For `<solvent>` = water, Li was not included in DFT calculations (benchmark calculations)
